What it do?! My name is Michael, I'm 30. I've been a teacher for 3 years, before that I worked in the food service industry for 11 years, and I've also been a freelance theatre artist (sometimes even getting paid) since 2009. Before that I was just an amateur studying theatre. 
I'm learning code because I have very little prospects if something should happen to my teaching gig. I have a family so I can't just pick up and leave.
